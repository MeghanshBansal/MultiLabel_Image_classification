# MultiLabel_Image_classification
Classify images which are distributed between multiple labels.

## Install
1) Pandas
2) Tensorflow
3) Matplotlib
4) Opencv-Python

## Dataset: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AaAzttk60kLKonFrViMzz2ssn9LFT7rQ?usp=sharing

The dataset contains 7254 movies with multiple genre labels
Augmentation has also been done on images to increase the dataset size.

## Models:
One hot encoding of the target variable is also been done.<br>
I have used Convolutional neural network for the multilabel classification.

- Convolutional Neural Network: 
A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms. While in primitive methods filters are hand-engineered, with enough training, ConvNets have the ability to learn these filters/characteristics.
